braggPeak.C
what:
Script that produces comparison between hadrontherapy
mc-simulation data and E.Haettner's experimental data.
requires:
run that is completed with the primitive command based scorer in the 
macro uncommented.

checkBeam.C
what:
Macro for checking carbon beam FWHM
requires:
Run that is run (usually) without a water-phantom. If other lengths then three meters are required 
code needs to be recompiled and the water-phantom moved in IAEAdetectorconstruction.

fragmentAngularDistribution.C
what:
Root script that produces a graph of the angular distribution of
a certain type of charged fragments itneractively.
requires:
works with any type of run. But to compare with data requires data-file with the same style name to be available.

fragmentAngularDistributionGM.C
what:
Only good for comapring resutls to Gunzer-Marx.
(could be removed)

fragmentAngularDistributionHistogram.C
what:
produces a equally binned angular distribution, not comparable to haettner, but "the right way of doing it".
requires:
will work with any run

fragmentEnergy.C
what:
produces energy distribution of charged fragments
requires:
exp. data only available for 27.1cm water phantom thickness.

fragmentYields.C
Tells you simply how big the yield is at 0-10 degrees for a file
requires:
works with any file

fragmentYieldsPlot.C
what:
plots 0-40 cm of yields, comparable to haettner
requires:
simulation files at different depth IAEA_1 .. IAEA_2 etc. in macro/depth/yields to be run (all of them!)

fragmentEnergyDistributionDifferentAngles.C
what:
plots the fragmentEnergy.C stuff for a number of angles with same color-coding as GSI data is published with in the same histogram.
requires:
works with any file but has no data to compare to (missing in data-set
